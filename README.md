**Multi-purpose Telegram Bot** is a telegram bot based on ASP.NET Core & [Telegram.Bot](https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot).

The main idea of this bot is to use filter-handler architecture similar to ASP.NET routes and controllers.

It consists of a single router and many filters that decide what handler will with a received message. Thus handlers have only one responsibility - get some information from the message and do something based on that info.

That way you don't need to put all your logic in a single controller.
